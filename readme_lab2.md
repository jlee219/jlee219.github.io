"Please write a short narrative to introduce your work, and describe the maps and the word clouds. Please analyze why the maps or word clouds
are different from each other. This narrative needs to be written on a readme.md file."

I decided to use the Twitter API tweet crawler to visualize the density of tweets based on two different topics at two different times.
I used the topic of Ukraine earlier in the morning, and then I used the topic of the NBA later in the day. I had also had setup the time
for the crawler to search for Ukraine to be five minutes but the NBA only had one minute.

The map of the Ukraine tweets was the most defined out of the two. Of course this was to be expected with five times the amount of runtime
for the crawler. But it also had points where the NBA had none. The NBA map in comparison is a lot more noticably gravitated towards areas
where NBA teams are located.

The word cloud for Ukraine largely most frequently used the words job, out, and day. The word cloud for the NBA had go, job, and up as the
three most used. It was rather interesting to see that job was very frequently used for both topics. It's clear that people either have a
lot to say about their jobs or the jobs that other people may be doing. Otherwise the words for NBA revolved mainly around movement or 
cheering, while Ukraine had a lot more variance in the types of words being used.
